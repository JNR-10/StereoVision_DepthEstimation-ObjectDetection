Contributing
============

Thanks for your interest in contributing! A few guidelines to get started:

1. Filing issues
   - Provide a short title and a clear description of the problem or enhancement.
   - Include environment details: OS, Python version, PyTorch version, install method.
   - Attach logs and a minimal reproduction if possible.

2. Pull requests
   - Fork the repository and open a feature branch.
   - Keep PRs focused and small (one logical change per PR).
   - Run linters and tests locally before opening a PR (black, flake8, pytest).
   - Describe the change in the PR and link any related issues.

3. Coding style
   - Follow PEP8 for Python code.
   - Use `black` for formatting and `flake8` for static checks.

4. Tests
   - Add unit tests for new features or bug fixes where practical.

5. Licensing
   - By contributing you agree to license your contributions under the project's license (see `LICENSE`).

If you are unsure, open an issue and we'll discuss the best approach.
